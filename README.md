# Exam project of WOHI 2025
This project features an art site that uses Art Institute of Chicago's API and BootsWatch Journal-theme.
The exam allowed usage of AI and the time for completion was max 3 hours.
We were tested on the underastanding the big ideas of software development, React-framework and Node.js usage
and how efficiently you could use AI to help with finish the project in short amounts of time.

To run the site:
Install Node.js if not already installed.
Open a terminal and go to your project folder.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Youll need to install npm packages, such as bootswatch, bootstrap, @mui/material, react-router-dom.

(Optional) Run npm run build to create a production build.
